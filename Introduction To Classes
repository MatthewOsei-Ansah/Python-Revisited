"""
Variables within a class are called attributes and functions are called methods
You can have multiple objects in the same class each with unique attributes
A class is a blueprint for an object
Meaning whenever we want to create an object we first need to create a class
"""

"""
A class can also inherit from another class 
The resulting objects will have attribute and methods from both classes 
"""

"""
Why use classes and objects
1. They organise complex code
2. They help to create reusable code
3. They ae used everywhere i.e. if you don't understand them then your in trouble
4.Some modules require you to use classes. For example Pi Game, HT, tkinter and MATLAB
5. They will make it easier to work with scope
