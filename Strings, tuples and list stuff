print(''.join(['one','two'])) # Joins the 2 arguments then outputs the result, the first '' dictates what goes in between each arguement when conjoined. All values have to be a string 

print(' '.join(['one','two','three','four','five'])) # Added a space between each arguement

 # Exercise print out test list joined with out the commas or square brackets
